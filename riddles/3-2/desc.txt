For Delphi, there's a big obstacle to finish his job to build the tower. He has found that the blueprint left by his father is a blueprint for a 2-D tower! However, as a smart boy, Delphi has figured out a way to make a 3-D blueprint that holds the same design spirit as his father's. Once again, can you help Delphi to determine the maximum weight for blocks in each layer of the newly designed 3-D blueprint?
