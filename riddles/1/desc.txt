There is a saying in Chinese. It says "A mountain cannot accommodate two tigers".

The teaching in this saying is that you can't have two powers with matching strength in the same arena. They will fight for resource and space until there's only one power left.

Likewise, we also know one nation can't have two queens. They will fight until there's only one queen left.

In the world of raku riddles, queens are usually very possessive. They don't want any other queens touch their own territory.

With this in mind, can you solve this riddle?
