You are a soldier from a Roman legion. Your troops are surrounded by a large number of barbarians.
Your legion needs help! Desperately!
Now you're assigned the task to pass the message of being surrounded to another legion located at the base camp 30 miles away.
You're disguised as a peasant and the message is written down on scroll. However, the barbarians are very skeptical! They'll examine everything in your bag if you're caught.
Now, come up with a method to ensure your message can't be deciphered by the barbarian if you're caught.
