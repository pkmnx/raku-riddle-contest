Once upon a time, an architect called Delphi found a blueprint of a tower left by his father. There's a certain beauty of symmetry in this blueprint and every layer of the tower is closely related to its previous layer. If you have a closer look at one building block of a layer, you'll find that the weight of the building block could be determined by the weights of building blocks in the previous layer. Now, in order to prepare enough blocks to build this tower, Delphi needs to know the maximum weight of blocks in each layer. Can you help him?
